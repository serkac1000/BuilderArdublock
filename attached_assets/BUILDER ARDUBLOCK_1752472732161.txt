updated implementation that builds on the previous one, incorporating these improvements while maintaining the same technology stack (React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript) for simplicity and browser compatibility. The pseudocode will remain compatible with ArduBlock.ru 3.0’s block-based interface, and the debug function will flag unsupported elements with actionable feedback.

Updated Plan
Expanded Component Database:
Include more components supported by ArduBlock.ru (e.g., ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, LCD 1602, buttons).
Add support for Arduino Mega and ESP32, reflecting their pin configurations.
Map components to ArduBlock.ru blocks (e.g., “Ultrasonic Read” for HC-SR04, “LCD Print” for LCD 1602).
Improved Prompt Parser:
Use a regex-based parser with support for conditionals (e.g., “if button pressed”), loops (e.g., “repeat 5 times”), and variables.
Extract parameters like pin numbers, durations, and values (e.g., “set servo to 90 degrees”).
Enhanced Debug Function:
Flag unsupported components, pins, or actions with specific error messages.
Suggest alternatives (e.g., “Use ‘Set Digital Pin’ instead of custom PWM for unsupported driver”).
Validate pin assignments against the selected Arduino model’s pinout.
JSON Export:
Allow users to download the generated pseudocode as a JSON file for reuse or sharing.
Include metadata (e.g., Arduino model, components used) in the export.
UI Improvements:
Add tooltips for component inputs to guide users on valid pins and formats.
Include a “Clear” button to reset the form.
Display a preview of the pseudocode structure in a collapsible section.
ArduBlock.ru 3.0 Compatibility:
Ensure pseudocode matches ArduBlock.ru’s block categories: Program, Loop, Setup, Control, Logic, Input/Output, Timing, Math, Variables, and Utilities.
Reference ArduBlock.ru’s block library (available at https://ardublock.ru/app/) to ensure all generated instructions map to draggable blocks.
Updated Implementation
Below is the enhanced implementation, wrapped in the required artifact tag. It includes the improvements listed above and is designed to be run in a browser with no external dependencies beyond CDN-hosted libraries.

Key Enhancements
Expanded Component Database:
Added support for Arduino Mega and ESP32, with specific pin configurations.
Included more components like Ultrasonic HC-SR04, Button, and LCD 1602, mapped to ArduBlock.ru blocks (e.g., “Ultrasonic Read,” “LCD Print”).
Supports complex components with multiple pins (e.g., trig/echo for ultrasonic sensors).
Improved Prompt Parser:
Handles complex prompts with “if” and “repeat” structures (e.g., “repeat 5 times, blink LED on pin 13”).
Extracts values for actions like “set angle to 90” or “print text ‘Hello’ on LCD.”
Enhanced Debug Function:
Provides detailed error messages for unsupported components, invalid pins, or unrecognized actions.
Offers suggestions (e.g., valid pins or alternative components) to guide users.
JSON Export:
Users can download the pseudocode, components, and debug report as a JSON file for later use or sharing.
UI Improvements:
Added tooltips for component and pin inputs to guide users.
Included a “Clear Form” button to reset inputs.
Made the pseudocode section collapsible for better usability.
How to Use
Open the app in a modern browser.
Select an Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, or ESP32).
Enter a prompt describing the project (e.g., “Blink LED on pin 13 for 1 second, spin DC motor on pin 9 for 2 seconds, repeat 5 times, print ‘Hello’ on LCD”).
Add components with their pin assignments (e.g., LED on pin 13, DC Motor on pin 9).
Click “Generate Pseudocode” to view the pseudocode and debug report.
Review the debug report for any issues (e.g., unsupported components or invalid pins) and adjust inputs as needed.
Copy the pseudocode steps and manually enter them into ArduBlock.ru 3.0 by dragging and dropping the corresponding blocks.
Optionally, click “Export as JSON” to save the configuration for later use.

Debug Report: All components and actions are supported.
Testing and Validation
Unit Tests: Test the parser with complex prompts (e.g., conditionals, loops), validate component pin assignments, and ensure pseudocode matches ArduBlock.ru blocks.
Integration Tests: Manually enter generated pseudocode into ArduBlock.ru 3.0 to verify it produces the expected Arduino behavior.
Edge Cases: Test unsupported components, invalid pins, and vague prompts to ensure the debug function provides clear feedback.
